# SchoolYard

SchoolYard is a messaging app with a built-in calendar that schools can use to keep students’ parents informed about their activities.

Schools use messaging apps to communicate with parents’ students that do not have built-in calendar functionality. This forces instructors to use ad-hoc methods to inform parents about events/activities/meetings, leaving parents susceptible to losing track of that information.

Adding a calendar to a school’s messaging app would make that information easier for the parents to refer to, thereby increasing their engagement in their children’s school lives. Ultimately, more engaged parents result in better educational outcomes for their children.
